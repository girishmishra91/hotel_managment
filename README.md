## Database Schema

The system uses a `hotel_management` database with the following tables:

### `rooms`
| Column Name      | Data Type        | Constraints             | Description                   |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `roomId`         | INT             | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique identifier for each room. |
| `roomType`       | VARCHAR(50)     | NOT NULL                | Type of the room (e.g., Single, Double, Suite). |
| `isAvailable`    | BOOLEAN         | DEFAULT TRUE            | Room availability status.     |
| `pricePerNight`  | DECIMAL(10, 2)  | NOT NULL                | Cost of the room per night.   |


CREATE DATABASE hotel_management;
USE hotel_management;

CREATE TABLE rooms (
    roomId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    roomType VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    isAvailable BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    pricePerNight DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
